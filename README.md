1. read the extract and determine whether other docs are required?
2. clean the other doc(s) text
3. do the other docs actually relate to the original or has it been passed out?
4. ask the original docs for any rights(benefits vs subjected) - insert fake one to show it what to do
8. do the same as above for the other docs for any rights that others have
10. Do the same for covenants / restrictions
11. create text

11. (bonus point time) summarise email history and advise 
    - all text on file history
    - can we safely ignore anything?
    - how much text are we talking?
