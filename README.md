Demo project for QA extraction using GPT3 written in May 2022.

Drop the text of a UK property register into the text area and hit 'Check' to extract the data from the register into a table.

Clone the repo then npm install / npm run build / npm start to get going.

You'll need a '.env.local' file with the 'OPENAI_API_KEY' set to a valid OpenAI key.
